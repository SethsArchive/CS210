1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
        -The project creates a file using java by asking the user to enter in data for animals and then using c++ to display and edit the information.
        
2.) What did you do particularly well?
        -I feel that I did very well with setting up the class and vector to store the data and make it easy to use and understand. 
        
3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
        -I feel that I could do more memory management to make sure no memory leaks would occur.
        
4.) Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
        -Creating the vector of object pointers was a little difficult for me. At first I was trying to user multiple classes, a base and a couple
        derived, however, I found difficulty accessing and storing the information efficiently. I ended up settling for a single class which kept track of everything.
        
5.) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
        -The use of classes and slight user of pointers can be applicable to future projects and course work as they offer many advantages.
        
6.) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
        -I keep the progarm readable by offering comments that explain just about everything and keeping variable names understandable. I keep instructions that usually relate to 
        each other grouped together while separating things that don't, even if it is a single line. I try to keep lines indented perfectly to show the flow and logic of how               the program goes about its business.
